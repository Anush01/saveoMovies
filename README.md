# saveoMovies

Hi there, My name is Anush and I've tried to build a movie poster display app here. It shows all the posters of the most popular movies in a recyclerView
using the Paging 3 library. It's implemented in MVVM and written in Kotlin. I've used coroutines and livedata. Let me know what you think. Thanks!
